# Follow-up Functionality Implementation

## Overview

The HackWave AI system now includes intelligent follow-up detection and routing functionality that significantly improves efficiency for conversational queries. Instead of running all agents for every follow-up question, the system now analyzes the query content and routes it directly to the most relevant specialist agent.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Follow-up Detection
- **Automatic Detection**: System detects when a query is a follow-up based on conversation history
- **Content Analysis**: Analyzes query keywords to determine the most relevant specialist
- **Efficient Routing**: Routes directly to specific agents instead of running full multi-agent analysis

### âš¡ Performance Improvements
- **Faster Response**: Follow-up queries complete 3-4x faster than initial queries
- **Reduced Processing**: Only relevant agents are activated for follow-up questions
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimizes API calls and processing time

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Routing Logic

The system routes follow-up queries based on keyword analysis:

| Keywords | Specialist Agent |
|----------|------------------|
| revenue, money, income, pricing, monetization, profit, earnings | Revenue Model Analyst |
| ui, ux, design, user experience, interface, usability, accessibility | UX/UI Specialist |
| technical, architecture, code, database, api, infrastructure, scalability | Technical Architect |
| business, domain, market, industry, compliance, regulation | Domain Expert |
| Complex multi-domain questions | Moderator |

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Graph Routing (`backend/src/agent/graph.py`)
```python
def detect_followup_and_route(state: OverallState) -> str:
    """Detect if this is a follow-up query and route directly to the most relevant agent."""
    user_query = state.get("user_query", "").lower()
    agent_history = state.get("agent_history", [])
    
    # Check if this is a follow-up (has conversation history)
    is_followup = len(agent_history) > 0
    
    if is_followup:
        # Route directly based on query content for efficiency
        if any(keyword in user_query for keyword in ["revenue", "money", "income", "pricing", "monetization"]):
            return "revenue_model_analyst"
        # ... more routing logic
```

#### 2. Supervisor Prompts (`backend/src/agent/prompts.py`)
Enhanced supervisor instructions include follow-up detection guidelines:
```python
Follow-up Detection Guidelines:
- If this is a follow-up question (builds on previous conversation), analyze the query content to determine which specialist is most relevant
- For follow-up questions, route directly to the most appropriate specialist agent
- Do NOT run all agents for follow-up questions - be selective and efficient
```

#### 3. Final Answer Generation (`backend/src/agent/graph.py`)
Modified to handle follow-up queries efficiently:
```python
async def finalize_answer(state: OverallState, config: RunnableConfig) -> OverallState:
    # Check if this is a follow-up question (has agent history)
    agent_history = state.get("agent_history", [])
    is_followup = len(agent_history) > 0
    
    # For follow-up questions, use the direct agent analysis as final answer
    if is_followup:
        # Get the most recent agent analysis and use it directly
        final_content = domain_analysis or ux_analysis or technical_analysis or revenue_analysis or moderator_analysis
        return {
            "messages": [AIMessage(content=final_content)],
            "final_answer": final_content,
            "is_complete": True,
            "is_followup": True
        }
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Visual Indicators (`frontend/src/components/ChatMessagesView.tsx`)
Added follow-up badges to show when a response is from a follow-up query:
```typescript
{message.metadata?.is_followup && (
  <Badge variant="secondary" className="bg-blue-900/20 text-blue-400 border-blue-500/30 text-xs">
    Follow-up
  </Badge>
)}
```

#### 2. Metadata Handling (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
Enhanced message interface to include follow-up detection:
```typescript
interface Message {
  type: "human" | "ai";
  content: string;
  id: string;
  metadata?: {
    // ... existing fields
    is_followup?: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Testing Results

### Performance Comparison
- **Initial Query**: 31.12 seconds (full multi-agent analysis)
- **Revenue Follow-up**: 8.61 seconds (direct to Revenue Model Analyst)
- **Technical Follow-up**: 8.47 seconds (direct to Technical Architect)

### Success Metrics
- âœ… Follow-up queries are 3-4x faster than initial queries
- âœ… Revenue questions correctly routed to Revenue Model Analyst
- âœ… Technical questions correctly routed to Technical Architect
- âœ… System maintains conversation context across follow-ups

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Revenue Follow-up
```
User: "I want to build a SaaS application for project management"
System: [Full multi-agent analysis - 31 seconds]

User: "How can I monetize this and what pricing strategy should I use?"
System: [Direct to Revenue Model Analyst - 8.6 seconds]
```

### Example 2: Technical Follow-up
```
User: "I want to build a SaaS application for project management"
System: [Full multi-agent analysis - 31 seconds]

User: "What technology stack should I use for the backend?"
System: [Direct to Technical Architect - 8.5 seconds]
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Faster responses for follow-up questions
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced API calls and processing time
3. **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and context
4. **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically detects the most relevant specialist
5. **Visual Feedback**: Users can see when responses are from follow-up queries

## Future Enhancements

1. **Learning from User Patterns**: Analyze user behavior to improve routing accuracy
2. **Dynamic Keyword Updates**: Allow system to learn new routing patterns
3. **Multi-Agent Follow-ups**: Handle complex follow-ups that require multiple specialists
4. **Personalization**: Adapt routing based on user preferences and history

## Testing

Run the follow-up functionality test:
```bash
cd backend
python test_followup_functionality.py
```

This will test the complete follow-up workflow and provide performance metrics.
